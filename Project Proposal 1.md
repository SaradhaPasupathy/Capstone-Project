#### Project Name
Real Estate Sales  - State of Connecticut

#### Description

The real estate market in the United States has rebounded significantly from the housing crash of the late-2000s, with low interest rates and limited inventory creating an ideal environment for sellers in some parts of the country. Buyers, on the other hand, often face escalating real estate prices, bidding wars and prolonged search periods as they enter an increasingly competitive market.  

However Economically, Connecticut has been one of the slowest states in the nation to recover from the economic shock of the 2008 recession. President and CEO of Connecticut REALTORS Michael Barbaro says that Connecticut’s housing market is “defying the laws of economics,” in an interview. “We have low inventory and flat prices. Normally, with low inventory we should have high prices.” he said,

In this Capstone project, The connecticut real estate prices for the year 2011,2012,2013,2014 will be examined, study the factors influencing it and  predict the real estate prices for the future.
