# Capstone-Project Ideas

### Idea 1 -  A Study of Greenhouse Gases Emission 

#### Project Description :
Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases(GHG).
Carbon dioxide (CO2)
Methane (CH4)
Nitrous oxide (N2O)
Fluorinated gases

#### Questions:
% Emission of GHG from different sectors?
Sources of Emission of GHG and trends in recent years?
Any changes that can be done in Land Management Practices?

#### Data
Emissions by Sector : http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EM
Land Use Data: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GL


### Idea 2 - Food Intake and Nutrition
Food choices influence the health and well-being of individuals. Current dietary concerns include the overconsumption of calories, added sugars, and saturated fats; underconsumption of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and health conditions such as obesity.
Food and dietary choices are influenced not only by prices and income, but also by family structure, time constraints, psychological factors, nutritional information, and Federal food and nutrition assistance programs. 

#### Questions
What is the recommended Food Nutrition? 
How to help consumers meet the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines and manage their weight by understanding how many calories are consumed from "extras" ?
