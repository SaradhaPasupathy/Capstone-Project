# Capstone-Project Ideas

### Idea 1 -  A Study of Greenhouse Gases Emission 

#### Project Description :  
Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases(GHG).Greenhouse gases include Carbon dioxide (CO2),Methane (CH4), Nitrous oxide (N2O),Fluorinated gases. Greenhouse gases trap heat and make the planet warmer. Human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years.1 The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.

#### Questions:  
% Emission of GHG from different sectors?  
Sources of Emission of GHG and trends in recent years?  
How long do they stay in the atmosphere?
Any changes that can be done in Land Management Practices?  

#### Data  
Emissions by Sector : http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/EM  
Land Use Data: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GL  


### Idea 2 - Food Intake and Nutrition
Food choices influence the health and well-being of individuals. Current dietary concerns include the overconsumption of calories, added sugars, and saturated fats; underconsumption of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and health conditions such as obesity.
Food and dietary choices are influenced not only by prices and income, but also by family structure, time constraints, psychological factors, nutritional information, and Federal food and nutrition assistance programs. 

#### Questions
What is the recommended Food Nutrition?  
How to help consumers meet the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines and manage their weight by understanding how many calories are consumed from "extras" ?
